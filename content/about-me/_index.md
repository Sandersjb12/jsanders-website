# About Me

Hello! My name is Jennifer Sanders and I’m a network engineer located near Olympia, Washington, USA.

I currently work for NTT DATA Inc in the Global IP NOC where I do a variety of things from supporting customers directly on the phone or via email to running migrations or software upgrades on our backbone. I'm very proud to steward a world-class network that enables the free and open exchange of information around the world.

This will be a bit of an extended resume/CV with some items that don't fit on a single PDF page. You can also find the abbreviated "HR version" in PDF for download below. :)

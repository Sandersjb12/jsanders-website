## Welcome to jennsanders.net!

My name is Jennifer Sanders and you've stumbled across my personal website! I'm a network engineer located near Olympia, Washington, USA.

This site exists to show off my personal projects in a bit more detail than you might want to cram onto a resume. :)

Above (and below), you'll find links to various sections:

 - [About me](/about-me) - personal and professional info about myself
 - [dn42](/dn42) - details about [dn42](https://dn42.eu/Home) and my own AS4242422914, including a [looking glass](https://lg.dn42.jennsanders.net/)
 - [Homelab](/homelab) - overview of my personal hybrid-cloud homelab infrastructure supporting dn42 AS4242422914 and other services

The website itself is a static site written in markdown with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [Terminal](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-terminal/) theme. You can find the [source code on my GitHub](https://github.com/Sandersjb12/jsanders-website).

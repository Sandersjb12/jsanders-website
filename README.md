My name is Jennifer Sanders and you've stumbled across my personal website! I'm a network engineer located near Olympia, Washington, USA.

This site exists to show off my personal projects in a bit more detail than you might want to cram onto a resume. :)

The website itself is a static site written in markdown with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [Terminal](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-terminal/) theme. You can find the [source code on my GitHub](https://github.com/Sandersjb12/jsanders-website).
